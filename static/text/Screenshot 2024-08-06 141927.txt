e Â» ISMS scope

x3 Decide what type of information your ISMS needs to

protect. What do your customers expect to be included in
your ISO 27001 certificate?

ISO 27,001 says that in order to establish the scope of the Isms, the company must
consider the external and internal issues part of the context discussed by us earlier.

So, the scope will have to clarify what activities, what processes, and which
organizational units are covered by the isms.
